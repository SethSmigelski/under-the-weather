## Description

Under The Weather is a powerful yet simple plugin designed to display location-specific weather forecasts on your WordPress site. Featuring a dedicated "Under The Weather Forecast" block to add and customize weather widgets directly in the WordPress editor for a seamless workflow.

With performance in mind, Under The Weather uses a server-side caching system (WordPress Transients) to minimize API calls and ensure your site remains fast. Under The Weather is completely "vanilla" on the front-end, meaning it does not rely on jQuery or any other JavaScript frameworks. Built with modern security practices, including input validation, CSRF protection, and optional rate limiting to protect your site and API quota.

This plugin is ideal for travel blogs, outdoor activity sites, or any website that needs to display weather conditions for specific locations without the bloat of heavy, multi-dependency plugins.

### Key Features:
* **Stylish Weather Widgets:** Choose between default OpenWeather images or the crisp Weather Icons font set.
* **Easy to Use:** Add weather widgets using the WordPress block editor or by placing a simple `<div>` with data attributes anywhere on your site.
* **Server-Side Caching:** All API calls are cached on your server, dramatically reducing calls to the OpenWeather API and speeding up page loads for all users.
* **Visual Performance Report:** Monitor your site's API usage with a bar chart that displays a 7-day history of cached requests versus new calls to the OpenWeather API - a clear look at how the caching system is working to keep your site fast and your API calls low.
* **Customizable Display:** Use the main display to show either the current live weather or the high/low forecast for the current day, and set the number of days to include in the forecast ahead.
* **Imperial & Metric Units:** Display weather in Fahrenheit/mph or Celsius/kph on a per-widget basis.
* **Extra Details:** Optionally display "Feels Like" temperature and detailed wind information.
* **Weather Alerts:** Display official severe weather alerts directly in the widget to keep visitors informed. 
* **Sunrise & Sunset Times:** Optionally show daily sunrise and sunset times, with 12-hour and 24-hour format options. 
* **Lightweight:** Enqueues assets only when needed and does not rely on heavy JavaScript libraries.
* **Settings Page Coordinate Finder:** An easy-to-use tool on the settings page retrieves coordinates by location name and generates ready-to-use widget `<div>` code.
* **Block Editor Coordinate Finder:** Search for locations by name and automatically fill in coordinates without ever leaving the block editor.

## Usage

The Under The Weather plugin offers two ways to add a weather forecast: using the block editor or manually placing a `<div>`.

### Using the Block Editor (Recommended)

1.  Open the post or page where you want to display the weather.
2.  Click the block inserter icon (+) to add a new block.
3.  Search for "Under The Weather Forecast" and add the block.
4. Configure your location using either:
   - Manual entry of coordinates in the block settings sidebar
   - The built-in coordinate finder that searches by location name and fills in the coordinates for you
5. Choose your preferred units (Imperial/Fahrenheit or Metric/Celsius)
6. Publish or update your post - the weather will display automatically!

### Manual Placement (Classic Editor & Themes)
To display the weather widget on a post, page, or in a template file, add a simple `<div>` element with the class `weather-widget` and the required data attributes.

* `data-lat`: The latitude for the forecast.
* `data-lon`: The longitude for the forecast.
* `data-location-name`: The city or location name you want to display as the title of the widget. (Beyond its display purpose, the 'data-location-name' is also used to create the shared cache key).
* `data-unit` (optional): The unit system for temperature and wind speed. Accepts `metric` or `imperial`. The default unit is `imperial` if not provided.

**Examples:**

```html
<div class="weather-widget" 
     data-lat="34.1186" 
     data-lon="-118.3004" 
     data-location-name="Los Angeles, California">
</div>
```

To show the weather for a location in Celsius, you would add `data-unit="metric"`:

```html
<div class="weather-widget" 
     data-lat="48.8566" 
     data-lon="2.3522" 
     data-location-name="Paris, France"
     data-unit="metric">
</div>
```

The plugin's JavaScript will automatically find this element and populate it with the forecast.

### Using the Shortcode (Classic Editor & Widgets)

You can also display the weather by using the `[under_the_weather]` shortcode. This is ideal for the Classic Editor, text widgets, or other page builders.

**Available attributes:**
* `lat`: (Required) The latitude for the forecast.
* `lon`: (Required) The longitude for the forecast.
* `location_name`: (Required) The name to display for the location.
* `unit`: (Optional) The unit system. Accepts `metric` or `imperial`. Defaults to `imperial`.

**Example:**
`[under_the_weather lat="48.8566" lon="2.3522" location_name="Paris, France" unit="metric"]`

## Configuration

Before you begin, go to https://home.openweathermap.org/ and sign up for an API key and register for the One Call API 3.0 subscription. Paste your API key into the Under the Weather Settings Page.

**API & Cache**

**Cache Expiration Time:** 
Use the slider to set the maximum time weather data is stored before fetching a new forecast, from 30 minutes to 8 hours. 

The plugin also features a **smart caching** system that automatically ensures the cache expires after midnight in the location's local timezone. This prevents showing a stale forecast from the previous day, regardless of your slider setting.

For displaying live conditions (using the **Primary Display** or **Extra Details** options), a shorter cache time of 1 or 2 hours is recommended.
For displaying only the daily high/low, a longer cache time of 3 or 8 hours is effective at reducing API calls.

**Widget Display & Style**

**Icon & Style Set:** 
Choose between the default PNG images provided by OpenWeather or the sharp, modern "Weather Icons" font set by Erik Flowers. Selecting the icon font will load an additional small CSS file.

**Primary Display:** 
Select whether the main display of the widget shows the **Current** live temperature or **Today's Forecast** (the high and low for the day).

**Number of Forecast Days:** 
Adjust the number of days shown in the extended forecast row, from 2 to 6 days.

**Extra Details:**
Selecting this option will **display 'Feels Like' and wind** (direction and speed) information beneath the primary display. This setting adds nuance to the current weather conditions display.

**Sunrise & Sunset:** This setting allows you to display the local sunrise and sunset times for the location, which is useful for planning outdoor activities.  Choose to show the times in a 12-hour (e.g., 6:30 AM) or 24-hour (e.g., 18:30) format.

**Weather Alerts:** When enabled, the widget will display any active severe weather alerts (e.g., thunderstorm warnings, flood advisories) issued by official authorities for the specified location.  This provides critical, at-a-glance information for your visitors.


**Display Timestamp:**
Indicates the time elapsed since the weather data was last updated from the source. This option helps readers see how recently the weather widget obtained its information. 

**Display Unit Symbol:**
Adds the unit symbol (F or C) next to the main temperature. This option allows you to select whether or not the widget should include the temperature unit symbol in the primary temperature display.

**Advanced Settings**
**Enable Cache:**  You can uncheck this box, if you would like to use this plugin without the benefit of the caching function. 

**Enable Rate Limiting:** Check this box to protect your site against excessive API requests from a single IP address. You can set the maximum number of requests per hour (default is 100). This helps prevent malicious traffic from exhausting your API quota.

**Asset Loading:** For the plugin to function correctly, the **Load Plugin CSS** and **Load Plugin JavaScript** boxes should normally remain checked. However, you can uncheck them if you prefer to include the plugin's CSS and JS files as part of your theme's own optimized assets.

If you uncheck **Load Plugin JavaScript**, you can load the Under The Weather scripts manually on select pages by adding the following template tag to your theme files (e.g., footer.php):

```php
<?php
if ( function_exists( 'under_the_weather_load_scripts_manually' ) ) {
   under_the_weather_load_scripts_manually(); 
} 
?>
```

For most users, simply leaving these boxes checked is the best way to use the weather widget.

## Performance Report

The Under The Weather plugin includes a powerful Performance Report tab in the settings page (**Settings > Under The Weather > Performance Report**) to give you clear insight into the plugin's efficiency and API usage. The main feature is a 7-day bar chart that provides a visual comparison of **cached hits versus new calls to the OpenWeather API**. 

The performance report demonstrates how the caching system is working to reduce external requests and keep your site fast. Use this report to fine-tune your **Cache Expiration Time** and observe the impact on your API call rate. 

The report also includes a status indicator that shows whether the optional **Rate Limiting** feature is currently active. If rate limiting is enabled and requests are being blocked, the raw data table at the bottom of the report will log these events. This can help you identify unusual traffic patterns or potential misuse of your API key.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What API key do I need?
This plugin works with the **OpenWeather One Call API 3.0**. You can get a free API key by signing up on the OpenWeather website. Make sure you have subscribed to the One Call API on your account's API page.

###  How can I monitor how many OpenWeather API calls the plugin is making?

Click on the "Performance Report" tab of the Under The Weather Settings Page to see a graph and data log for the last 7 days of plugin performance. The Performance Report shows the last seven days of information about the requests made by the weather widget. The report displays a comparison of the cached hits and calls to the OpenWeather API. 

Seeing how the plugin's cache system reduces the number of API calls demonstrates its effectiveness. Use the Performance Report to examine how modifying the cache expiration time affects the rate of cached requests.

###  Do I need to use the plugin's caching function?

No. To retrieve fresh weather data every time a widget page loads, you can uncheck "Enable Cache" under the plugin's advanced settings. The caching system provides a great benefit for reducing API hits, but turning off this function during your initial widget setup may be useful.

### Will my website ever show yesterday's weather If I set a long cache time?

Cinderella's magic disappears at midnight, and weather caches expire at midnight too. Visitors should never see a cache of the previous day's forecast. 

For example, if you set the cache expiration time to 8 hours and a weather cache is created at 10 p.m. on a Friday (using the weather location's time), that cache will expire at midnight, and someone visiting the site the next day at 5 a.m. will not see the previous day's cache even though fewer than 8 hours have passed.

The plugin uses whichever expiration time is **shorter** to provide the most effective caching.  You control the maximum cache duration with the "Cache Expiration Time" slider. However, to ensure your visitors never see yesterday's weather, the plugin also calculates the time until midnight in the widget's local timezone. If the time until midnight is shorter than your slider setting, the cache will expire at midnight.

### The weather isn't updating. Why?

The plugin caches the weather data on your server to improve performance and reduce API calls. The data will only be fetched again after the "Cache Expiration Time" you set on the settings page has passed. If you need to force an immediate update, go to **Settings > Under The Weather** and click the "Clear All Weather Caches" button.

### I made changes to my settings. Why isn't the widget updating?

The weather widget is probably displaying a cached forecast. Since waiting around is no fun, the Under The Weather Settings has a "Clear Weather Cache" option at the bottom. If you press the "Clear All Weather Caches & Stats" button, it will force an immediate update of all weather forecasts. This will also clear the performance report data.  

If you're feeling patient, just wait for the weather widget to update after the current cache has expired.

### Does the Weather Widget work in Fahrenheit or Celsius?

Both. By default, the weather widget will show a forecast in Fahrenheit. If you prefer to see the forecast in Celsius, set data-unit="metric" within the weather-widget div (see configuration instructions). Additionally, checking the box for "Display Unit Symbol" on the Under The Weather Settings page instructs the weather widget to display the temperature unit symbol (F or C) in the primary temperature display.

### What if I don't know the latitude and longitude for a weather location?

The plugin offers two methods for looking up coordinates using its built-in **Coordinate Finder** tool: 
* **In the Settings Page:** Navigate to **Settings > Under The Weather** and click the **Coordinate Finder** tab. Simply type in a location name, and the tool will look up the coordinates and provide you with the exact `<div>` code to copy and paste.
* **In the Editor:** While using the **Under The Weather Forecast** block, click on the **Find Coordinates By Name** button. The coordinates for your chosen location will be filled in for you automatically.

### How do I use the weather block?

In the WordPress block editor, simply search for "Under The Weather Forecast" when adding a new block. The block includes a built-in coordinate finder, so you can search for locations by name rather than manually entering latitude and longitude. Configure your preferences in the block settings sidebar, and the weather will appear automatically on your published page.

### Can I still use the manual div method if I prefer it?

Absolutely! While the **block** is the recommended, user-friendly method for the modern WordPress editor, the plugin fully supports traditional methods for maximum flexibility.

You can use the `[under_the_weather]` shortcode to easily place the widget in the Classic Editor, text widgets, or with various page builders. 

Additionally, the manual `<div>` method still works perfectly. It is particularly useful for theme developers who need to integrate the widget directly into template files or dynamically populate its data from custom fields.

The traditional method of adding `<div class="weather-widget">` with data attributes still works perfectly and is particularly useful for theme developers and sites that dynamically populate widget attributes from post meta or custom fields.

### What coordinate format should I use?

The recommended and most reliable format for coordinates is **Decimal Degrees (DD)**, for example: `34.1195`, `-118.3005`.

However, the **Under The Weather Forecast block** is designed to be user-friendly. If you enter coordinates in other common formats like **DMS** (e.g., `34°07'10.2"N`) or **DDM** (e.g., `34° 7.17' N`), the block will automatically convert them to the correct decimal format for you.

For the manual `<div>` method, it is strongly recommended to use Decimal Degrees. While the front-end script has a fallback to parse other formats, some characters (like the `"` symbol in DMS) can break the HTML structure and lead to incorrect coordinates. The block editor's converter is the most reliable way to handle alternate formats.

If you're unsure what coordinates to use, the **Coordinate Finder** tool is the best way to retrieve accurate coordinates in the correct format.

### Where do the weather alerts come from?

The alerts are provided directly by the OpenWeather API, which sources them from official meteorological agencies in each country. This ensures the information is timely and authoritative.

### What does the "Enable Rate Limiting" setting do?

This is a security feature that limits the number of times a single visitor (identified by their IP address) can request weather data in one hour. Enabling it helps protect your OpenWeather API key from being overused by automated bots or malicious users. For most websites, the default limit of 100 requests per hour is generous, but you can adjust it if needed.

The rate limit is turned off by default to ensure maximum performance for all users.  If you notice an unexpected increase in weather requests in the performance report, go ahead and turn on rate limiting to see if something is afoot.

### Can I load the JavaScripts myself?

Yes. By default, when "Load Plugin JavaScript" is selected, it will add scripts to every page of your website. If you only plan to display the weather widget on select pages, you could choose to only load the Under The Weather Scripts on those pages by encoding the JavaScript yourself. 

When Load Plugin JavaScript is unchecked, you can use this template tag to add the Under The Weather Scripts to your theme's footer.php file. 

```php
<?php  
if ( function_exists( 'under_the_weather_load_scripts_manually' ) ) {
 under_the_weather_load_scripts_manually(); 
} 
?>
```

For example, if you only intend to display the weather widget on events pages, you could add this targeted script to your theme's footer.php file:

```php
<?php
// Only load the weather script on single pages of the 'event' post type.
if ( is_singular('event') && function_exists('under_the_weather_load_scripts_manually') ) {
    under_the_weather_load_scripts_manually(); 
} 
?>
```

Adding scripts this way is purely optional. Most users can just leave the Load Plugin JavaScript box checked.

###  Are there additional ways to customize this plugin?

Yes. You can modify the appearance of the Weather Icons Fonts by making customizations using CSS. The Weather Icons Fonts are sharp, scalable, and can be customized through CSS to match your website's color palette.
